  "whatP" : "Interim management is a fast, flexible, and targeted strategic solution that enables companies to engage an experienced executive for a temporary period to address specific business challenges. An interim manager can immediately deliver measurable results, make difficult decisions, and act in the best interest of the company. Additionally, an interim executive can support process optimization, project management, strategic transformation, and change management, all without requiring long-term commitment. Interim management is an ideal tool for adapting to rapid market changes, seizing new business opportunities, or handling temporary leadership situations where critical decisions must be made for the company's success."
